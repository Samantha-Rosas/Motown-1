      <br>
      This print source is a comprehensive reference that includes insights into the Vietnam-era experiences and views of the primary creative force of each work, including print, sound, and motion pictures, and considers a discussion of the circumstances surrounding the creation of the work, a plot summary when appropriate, the critical reaction to the work, and sources for further reading. While this reference’s primary focus is the Vietnam War, it includes insight to the Black experience of returning veterans who were caught in the battles of home and those abroad. This is specifically covered in the section detailing Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans, a project by Wallace Terry. The volume finishes with an appendix listing more than 275 other works about the war.

      <br>
      This resource is an audio interview with television and radio broadcaster Alvin Hall who details the story of how Motown Records (originally Black Forum Label) was created and the founders’ hesitation on creating something overly political which contrasts with another source in this project regarding Motown Records. The audio also includes clips of the original Black Forum Label recordings including works by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Langston Hughes, and Margaret Danner.

      This research argues that funk music was the social protest discourse of poor and working-class Black youth after an apparent lull in protest activities in the 1970s and 1980s. The author posits that because large mainstream social protest movements were less apparent, a counter-protest movement emerged through the rhetorical means of funk music which used everyday experiences to challenge the dominant power structure and ideology of the time period. The article allows an expansion of insight into what happened after the Civil Rights Movement and serves as a place for comparison of trends within Black musicians.

      <br>
      Neal’s article discusses the historical commodification of Black music for the purposes of selling to the mass public. This, Neal argues, is what broke the bond between Black music and themes relevant to working-class, Black Americans, a contrast to Morant’s argument that there was a musical movement after the Civil Rights Movement. Much like Morant’s article, this establishes a narrative post the emphasis of the project and allows questions to be raised regarding the trends after the Protest Era and how these affect mainstream music.

      This article focuses on the influence that folk music had in the 60s. The author mentions the lack of solid definition of folk at this time. The majority of this article is in relation to the Vietnam war and the songs that were released at this time. “The earliest civil rights sings supported protests against segregation. Pete Seeger was the central figure here, and the best emotional feel for the movement comes from his Carnegie Hall concert.” These anti war songs were written by both white and black activist-songwriters. The argument this author poses is that music can enhance historical study by re-creating social and cultural mood and by illustrating an er’s common ideas and attitudes.

Motown joined the revolution in 1968-1975.“The terms ''revolution”or ''the revolution” (sometimes synonymous with “the struggle”) are threaded throughout Black activist text, which includes the texts of Black Forum label recordings.” This article goes through the history of black popular music. These explanations are split up into different phases, like R&B and Civil Rights Recordings, Classic Motown and soul,  and Social Consciousness, Political Activism and Cultural Awareness.

      This study examines the lyrics of country songs from 1960-2000) to try to understand the political and ideological content therein. Most successful songs have been explicitly apolitical, even ant-political, their rejection and apparent unawareness of social and economic conditions outside the lives of the song characters themselves. A big argument this article brings up is that ideology and politics involve people's deep perceptions and struggles over how their society is to be organized and toward which broad goals society moves. An interesting finding pointed out in this article was that “Freedom” was found to be a common theme, appearing in more than half the songs in the database they used.

    This article goes through the beginnings and history of Motown and the cultural significance this record had in history. It goes through the highs and lows of this musical movement. It also dives into the individual artists and groups under this record label. “ Motown reveals how the hopes and dreams of each affected the lives of the others and illustrates why this singular story is a made-in-America Greek tragedy, the rise and fall of a supremely talented yet completely dysfunctional extended family.”
