            <h4><i>The Sound </i></h4>

            People passing by the blue house on West Grand Boulevard could often get a taste of the smooth
            lyrics and southern-style rhythms that made “The Motown Sound.” Composed of raw rhythm and heavily
            influenced by blues music, the “southern sound” traveled north with Black Americans during the Great
            Migration when 6 million Black Americans traveled from the rural Southern United States to urban
            areas in the Northeast, Midwest, and West between 1916 and 1970. Detroit, Michigan became home to
            thousands of Black families—so much that the population between 1870 and 1920 multiplied 12 times
            its size.
            <br>
            <br>
            Young men arriving in Detroit were presented with three employment opportunities they could do
            without the education they could not have received in the South: work the assembly line in the
            booming auto industry, take on boxing, and music. Those who found their homes in jazz and blues
            clubs around town found themselves in direct competition with growing musicians like Elvis Presley
            who had taken the “southern sound” in 1956 and made
            it popular while pushing those who were responsible for the sound (Black artists like Big Joe
            Turner, Ruth Brown, and Jackie Wilson) away from the spotlight. As Presley rose to the top of the
            charts, Black musicians realized that no matter how groovy and catchy their music was, it would not
            reach the same fame as long as it was tied to a black face.

            <br>
            In order to maintain independence from white musicians like Presley, Black musicians created their
            spaces in underground jazz and blues clubs where their music would shift and change and innovate. It
            was in these places, late at night, where Berry Gordy Jr found successes like James “Igor” Jamerson
            who saw the potential in using Arabic, Latin, and Asian styles in the music he was playing. Gordy
            also stumbled upon Benny “Papa Zita” Benjamin, a drummer who’s unique snare beats would become a
            staple of ”The Motown Sound.” Over the years,
            Gordy’s collection of musicians would come together and call themselves “The Funk Brothers.”

            <br>
            <br>
            At the time, synthesizers were still a novel invention, so without access to one, Motown writers
            including Gordy Jr and the Funk Brothers had to get creative and began creating sounds that regular
            instruments could not produce. This included having artists stomp their feet to create a heavy
            bassline, shake jars full of various contents, and even drag chains across the floor to create
            unique sounds. In The Supremes’ 1964 release of “Where Did Our Love Go,'' a hand clap beat can be
            heard in the background. This was actually created by an Italian-American teenaged named Mike
            Valvano who stomped on two two-by-fours suspended by strings to create the sound of a group of
            foot-stompers. “Where Did Our Love Go” would go on to be the first single by the Supremes to hit #1 on the
            Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. They held that spot for two weeks.

            <br>
            The location where they recorded much of their music also showed their innovation and adaptability.
            Inside the blue two-story at 2648 W Grand Blvd was Studio A, a tiny basement that had been converted
            to a recording studio and referred to as the “Snakepit” by the musicians and singers who came in and
            out of that space. The soundproofing was created by old theater curtains and the walls were heavy
            with plaster to seal the cracks, but still, bands and singers created hit after hit inside those
            walls. According to Mary Wilson of the Supremes, working in such a tight space was “conducive to a
            better rapport between the singers and players” even if when one person messed up, everyone had to
            start over. The Snakepit was another aspect of what made Motown so unique, something that not even
            the biggest artists could recreate. This ability to push against barriers and come out with success
            defined the Motown Sound and spirit. When they saw that the cultural sound that made the Black
            experience was being stolen and repackaged by white musicians, they doubled down and made it their
            own again. This was also part of what made the Civil Rights Movement so successful—in both there was
            resilience and this resulted in black empowerment through music.

            <h4><i>The Movement</i></h4>
            In the world of music where for years, many black artists had been discredited as their
            music was stolen and sung by a white musician, Motown emerged to open a world for Black
            artists to find space on the charts among other mainstream musicians. This is the message
            that Black scholar Booker T. Washington preached during the 19th Century. Washington
            believed that Black Americans needed to achieve economic success because, in a
            capitalist-America, economic success translated into power. According to Washington, Black
            America was being held back because whites denied them economic freedom and therefore denied
            them power. The theme of black empowerment through economic success was central to the
            movement for civil rights. Activist and leader, Malcolm X once stated that much of the Black
            struggle came because “Black men don’t own and control their own community’s retail
            establishments
            that they can’t stabilize their own community.” Even at Gordy’s insistence that he and his
            company were neutral on the politics of the time, it is undeniable that Berry Gordy Jr and
            his Motown ensemble were an example of Malcolm X and Booker T Washington’s ideal Black
            economic independence.
            <br>
            <br>
            By 1972, Motown had produced more number one hits than the Beach Boys, the Rolling Stones,
            the Beatles, and Elvis Presley combined (CHART). More than ten of their acts and musicians
            would be honored in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame including The Supremes (honored in 1988),
            The Temptations (honored in 1989), and Marvin Gaye (honored posthumously in 1987). The
            business model that created a cultural phenomenon would transcend generations and allow for
            the creation of contemporary moguls from JAY-Z with Roc-A-Fella to Andre Harrell with Uptown
            Records to Sean "Diddy" Combs with Bad Boy.
            <br>
            <br>
            The 1960s were a time of political and social upheaval and Motown not only managed to
            survive this period but it exceeded all stereotypes and expectations for Black-owned
            businesses in America. Motown was embraced by the youth of the 60s and would be for
            generations to come. Stories that reflect the 60s are inaccurate without the influence and
            appearance and voice of Motown stars. By developing a new style and music, Motown was able
            to become the ultimate symbol of black success and independence.
