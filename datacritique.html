      From the title of the chosen dataset, “Evolution of Popular Music: USA 1960–2010,” we knew that the data provided would be something very involved. Through a bit more research on this data set we discovered that the purpose for the creation of this data was to produce a “classification of musical styles and study the evolution of musical diversity and disparity, testing, and rejecting, several classical theories of cultural change” and to then show whether pop music evolved continuously and if so, how rapidly did it throughout the three stylistic ‘revolutions’ during 1946, 1983, and 1991.
      <br>
      <br>
      The time range that the data covers (1960-2010) is both a limitation and a benefit to the project; a limitation because it appears that a lot of our time was spent on narrowing down to a specific time frame that fits what we wanted to explore throughout the project. On the other hand, the amount of data gave us the opportunity to explore topics across history and does not restrict our research.
      <br>
      <br>
      Within the dataset, the limitations are a little more obvious. Each row corresponds to a recording and the columns include information such as artist names, track name, date of entry into the Billboard charts, as well as information regarding the timbre, harmonies, and chord changes. Those points of data were difficult for us to give meaning within the context of this project because of our lack of knowledge on this technical side of music. Various “early studies focused on technical aspects of audio such as loudness, vocabulary statistics and sequential complexity, we have attempted to identify musically meaningful features.” which accounted for how popular they were to audiences in the United States. Based on our research there was a lot of importance and impact on song popularity on account of the sound frequency within the song. And that is where we found ourselves lost again, it seems like the data was simply just meant for a musicologist. Which leads to our next critique. 
      <br>
      <br>
      The dataset is primarily musicology based and therefore contains no classification of genre or artist gender. Additionally, the dataset is not very well organized. There is no clustering of tracks by artist, year, added to the chart, or anything to that extent making it look messy and somewhat confusing. This caused a lot of issues on our end because we did not have a starting point to even just explore to give us ideas on what we might want to focus on for the project. One last limitation we found is that according to the BBC the Top 40 Chart was developed in 1952. This dataset does not specify where the information was taken from (for example Billboard), so there is no way to know how much data is missing if any. With that said the data set is not a direct translation of the Billboard Charts.
      <br>
      <br>
      Still, this is an extensive dataset that offers a lot of research possibilities. We are able to compare different artists, despite the data set’s lack of organization.
